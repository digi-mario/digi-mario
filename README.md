# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work as a web designer with UI/UX skills (front-end designer). I'm based in Switzerland.

Since 2010 I've been living and breathing web development and creating modern and user friendly interfaces. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make the world a little better trought design and code.

<blockquote>"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs</blockquote>

I'm always trying to grow and learn something new. I lose track of time when I'm listening good songs or simply read a good book.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a webdesigner and web developer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on something great!
